# ScaleGuard - Security & Compliance

## CRUD/FLS Enforcement

ScaleGuard implements comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and Field-Level Security (FLS) controls to protect data and ensure proper access management.

### Object-Level Security
- All custom objects implement proper sharing rules
- CRUD permissions are enforced through permission sets
- Record-level security is maintained through organization-wide defaults
- Users can only access records they have permission to view

### Field-Level Security
- Sensitive fields are marked with appropriate visibility settings
- Field-level security is enforced through profile and permission set configurations
- Fields are masked or hidden for users without appropriate permissions
- Custom fields are secured through field-level security settings

### Permission Set Implementation
ScaleGuard uses three main permission sets:
1. **ScaleGuard_Admin**: Full access to all features and objects
2. **ScaleGuard_User**: Standard access to automation features
3. **ScaleGuard_Observability**: Access to logging and observability features only

## Data Masking and Redaction

ScaleGuard implements data masking and redaction to protect sensitive information in logs and reports.

### Log Data Masking
- Credit card numbers are masked (showing only last 4 digits)
- Social Security Numbers are redacted
- Email addresses are partially masked
- Phone numbers are obfuscated
- Any PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is sanitized

### Field-Level Redaction
- Sensitive custom fields are configured for automatic redaction
- Log entries containing sensitive data are processed before storage
- Redaction patterns are configurable through custom settings
- Audit logs track any redaction activities

### Data Encryption
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using Salesforce encryption
- Communication between systems uses TLS 1.2+ encryption
- API keys and tokens are stored securely
- All data transfers are authenticated and authorized

## Audit Logging and Monitoring

Comprehensive audit logging ensures all activities are tracked and monitored for security and compliance.

### Audit Trail Features
- All user actions are logged with timestamps and user context
- System events are recorded including job executions and incidents
- Configuration changes are tracked with before/after values
- Access logs capture who accessed what data and when
- Error events are logged with detailed stack traces

### Log Storage and Retention
- Audit logs are stored in custom objects for long-term retention
- Log retention policy configurable through ScaleGuard_Logging__c
- Logs are automatically purged based on retention settings
- Archive copies maintained for compliance requirements

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Real-time monitoring of security events
- Configurable alerts for suspicious activities
- Automated anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Integration with security monitoring tools
- Regular security report generation
