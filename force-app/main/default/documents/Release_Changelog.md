### Improvements and Fixes

#### Code Quality Enhancements
- Resolved all ESLint violations in LWC components
- Removed prohibited setTimeout usage from LWC components
- Fixed unused imports in LWC components
- Improved code documentation and ApexDocs comments
- Enhanced bulkification of Apex methods

#### Performance Optimizations

### Known Issues

#### Current Limitations
1. **Mocked AI/ML Integration**: The AI/ML triage service is currently mocked and requires external integration
2. **Limited Ticketing Systems**: Only basic integration patterns are implemented for external ticketing systems
3. **Demo Data Only**: Production data handling requires additional configuration
4. **Basic Alerting**: Alerting system is simplified and lacks advanced configuration options

#### Workarounds
1. For AI/ML integration, implement custom Apex classes that connect to external ML services
2. Extend ticketing integrations by implementing additional Apex controllers
3. Configure production data handling through custom metadata and settings
4. Customize alerting rules through the configuration interface

### Upgrade Notes

#### Migration Path
1. **Backup Existing Data**: Ensure all custom objects and configurations are backed up
2. **Review Configuration**: Check existing custom metadata configurations
3. **Test Environment**: Deploy to a sandbox environment first
4. **Permission Review**: Verify permission set assignments
5. **Data Migration**: Migrate any existing data as needed

#### Breaking Changes
No breaking changes in this release. All existing configurations should continue to work as expected.
