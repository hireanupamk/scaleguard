# ScaleGuard - Feature Documentation

## Unified Automation Studio (LWC)

The Unified Automation Studio provides a centralized interface for configuring and managing all ScaleGuard automation processes.

### Key Features

- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize and manage job dependencies
- **Execution History**: View past job executions and results
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates for running jobs

### Usage Guide
1. Navigate to the Automation Studio component
2. Select "Create New Job" to define a new automation process
3. Configure job properties including type, schedule, and dependencies
4. Save and activate the job configuration
5. Monitor execution through the dashboard

## Batch & Queueable Orchestration

ScaleGuard provides robust orchestration for batch and queueable jobs with metadata-driven configuration.

### Key Features
- **Metadata-driven Scheduling**: Configure schedules using custom metadata
- **Dependency Management**: Define execution order between jobs
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries and error notifications
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of job progress
- **Resource Management**: Efficient handling of governor limits

### Configuration
1. Create a new job record in ScaleGuard_Job__mdt
2. Set job type to "Batch" or "Queueable"
3. Define execution parameters and schedule
4. Configure error handling and notification settings

## Trigger & Flow Orchestration

ScaleGuard implements a sophisticated trigger orchestration framework that separates trigger logic from trigger definitions.

### Key Features
- **One Trigger Per Object Pattern**: Single trigger per object with handler delegation
- **Metadata-driven Configuration**: Configure trigger behavior through custom metadata
- **Bulk Processing**: Efficient handling of large data volumes
- **Recursive Prevention**: Static boolean flags to prevent recursive triggers
- **Flexible Handler Registration**: Register multiple handler classes

### Implementation Details
- Triggers are defined in standard Salesforce trigger syntax
- Trigger logic is delegated to handler classes
- Handler registration is managed through ScaleGuard_TriggerConfig__mdt
- All trigger handlers implement the IScaleGuardTriggerHandler interface

## Observability Engine and Dashboards

Real-time observability provides comprehensive insights into automation performance and system health.

### Key Features
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format with correlation IDs
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live monitoring of system health
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error identification and reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Key performance indicators for automation processes
- **Alerting System**: Configurable notifications for critical events

### Dashboard Components
1. **Health Overview**: System-wide health status
2. **Job Execution**: Real-time job execution tracking
3. **Error Analysis**: Trend analysis of system errors
4. **Log Explorer**: Search and filter capabilities for logs
5. **Incident Timeline**: Historical view of incidents and resolutions

## Incident Triage and Management

Automated incident detection and prioritization improves response times and system reliability.

### Key Features
- **Automated Detection**: Log analysis identifies potential incidents
- **Prioritization Engine**: AI/ML powered incident prioritization
- **Ticket Integration**: Create tickets in external systems (Jira, ServiceNow)
- **Incident Timeline**: Complete history of incident resolution
- **Escalation Rules**: Configurable escalation paths

### Process Flow
1. Log events are captured and analyzed
2. Potential incidents are flagged based on severity and patterns
3. Incidents are prioritized using defined criteria
4. Tickets are created in external systems
