# ScaleGuard Incident Management

## Overview
The ScaleGuard Incident Management system provides AI/ML-powered triage and incident management capabilities for the ScaleGuard platform. This system enables administrators and developers to automatically analyze incidents, assign priorities, and create tickets in external systems like Jira or ServiceNow.

## Key Components

### 1. AI/ML Triage Service (ScaleGuard_AI_Triage)
Provides intelligent analysis of error logs to:
- Assign priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Categorize incidents (Data, Integration, Process, Security, Performance)
- Predict resolution times based on priority and category

### 2. Incident Prioritization Component (sgIncidentPrioritization)
Provides a user interface for:
- Analyzing incidents by correlation ID
- Viewing priority assignments
- Setting incident categories
- Seeing predicted resolution times

### 3. Ticket Tracker Component (sgTicketTracker)
Displays a table of created tickets with:
- Ticket IDs
- Correlation IDs
- Priority levels
- Categories
- Statuses
- Assigned personnel
- Estimated resolution times

### 4. Incident Management Workflow (sgIncidentManagement)
Coordinates the entire incident management process:
- Accepts correlation IDs for analysis
- Integrates with prioritization and ticket tracking components
- Simulates ticket creation in external systems

### 5. Incident Manager Service (ScaleGuard_IncidentManager)
Backend service that:
- Coordinates the incident analysis workflow
- Calls the AI/ML triage service
- Creates mock tickets for demonstration
- Updates incident tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Apex Components
- **ScaleGuard_AI_Triage.cls**: AI/ML logic for incident analysis
- **ScaleGuard_IncidentManager.cls**: Backend service for incident management workflow

### Lightning Web Components
- **sgIncidentPrioritization**: Incident analysis and prioritization UI
- **sgTicketTracker**: Ticket tracking and visualization
- **sgIncidentManagement**: Main workflow coordinator

### Data Flow
1. User enters a correlation ID in the incident management component
2. System retrieves logs for that correlation ID
3. AI/ML service analyzes logs to assign priority and category
4. Resolution time is predicted based on priority and category
5. Mock ticket is created (simulating Jira/ServiceNow integration)
6. Ticket information is displayed in the tracker component

## AI/ML Triage Logic

### Priority Assignment
- **Critical**: Contains 'critical', 'fatal', or 'exception' in error messages
- **High**: Contains 'error', 'fail', or 'timeout' in error messages (2+ errors)
- **Medium**: Contains 'warning' or 'deprecation' in error messages
- **Low**: Default priority for all other cases

### Category Classification
- **Data**: Contains 'database', 'query', or 'record' in error messages
- **Integration**: Contains 'integration', 'api', 'soap', or 'rest' in error messages
- **Process**: Contains 'process', 'workflow', or 'approval' in error messages
- **Security**: Contains 'security', 'auth', or 'permission' in error messages
- **Performance**: Contains 'performance', 'timeout', or 'limit' in error messages
- **Other**: Default category for unrecognized patterns

### Resolution Time Prediction
Uses a lookup table based on priority and category combinations to estimate resolution times in hours:
- Critical Data: 2 hours
- High Integration: 6 hours
- Medium Process: 10 hours
- Low Performance: 16 hours
- And so on...

## Mocked External System Integration

### Ticket Creation
The system simulates integration with external ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow) by:
- Generating mock ticket IDs in the format TCK-XXXXXX
- Logging the ticket creation process
- Updating internal tracking records

### Status Tracking
The ticket tracker component displays:
- Ticket ID
- Correlation ID
- Priority level with color-coded indicators
- Category
- Status (Open, In Progress, Resolved)
- Assigned personnel
- Estimated resolution time

## Usage Scenarios

### Incident Analysis
1. Enter a correlation ID in the incident management component
2. Click "Analyze Incident"
3. View the automatically assigned priority and category
4. See the predicted resolution time

### Ticket Creation
1. After analysis, click "Create Ticket" in the prioritization component
2. A mock ticket is created and displayed in the ticket tracker
3. The ticket is assigned to the appropriate team based on category

### Incident Tracking
1. Use the ticket tracker component to view all created tickets
2. Filter and sort tickets by priority, status, or category
3. Monitor resolution progress

## Security and Performance Considerations

### Security
- All logging respects field-level security
- No sensitive data is stored in mock tickets
- Proper RBAC through component permissions
- Secure correlation ID handling

### Performance
- Efficient SOQL queries for log retrieval
- Mock data for demonstration purposes
- Asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Minimal overhead on production systems

## Future Enhancements

### AI/ML Improvements
- Integration with actual AI/ML services for more accurate predictions
- Learning from historical incident data to improve triage accuracy
- Natural language processing for better error interpretation

### External System Integration
- Real integration with Jira, ServiceNow, and other ticketing systems
- Support for multiple external systems
- Advanced ticket creation workflows with custom fields

### Enhanced Tracking
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Advanced filtering and reporting capabilities
- Automated escalation based on priority and time thresholds
- Integration with Slack/Teams for real-time notifications

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- All AI/ML methods have comprehensive test coverage
- Mock data used for priority assignment and categorization
- Error handling scenarios tested
- Integration tests for the incident manager workflow

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing of the incident management workflow
- Verification of component interactions
- Mock ticket creation validation
- Data flow validation between components

### Performance Testing
- Large dataset handling validation
- Response time measurements
- Memory usage monitoring
- Governor limit compliance checks
