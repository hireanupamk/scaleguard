# ScaleGuard System Architecture

## Overview

ScaleGuard is a next-generation Salesforce automation and observability platform designed for large, complex enterprise organizations. This document outlines the high-level architecture, components, and data flow of the platform.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
The presentation layer consists of Lightning Web Components (LWC) that provide the user interface for administration and monitoring:

- **Automation Studio** (`sgAutomationStudio`) - Central dashboard for managing automation workflows
- **Health Dashboard** (`sgHealthDashboard`) - Real-time monitoring of system health
- **Alerting System** (`sgAlerting`) - Real-time error notifications
- **Traceability** (`sgTraceability`) - Log correlation and search
- **Incident Management** (`sgIncidentManagement`) - Incident analysis and ticket creation
- **Demo Data** (`sgDemoData`) - Utilities for testing observability features

### 2. Business Logic Layer
The business logic layer contains the core Apex classes that implement the platform's functionality:

- **ScaleGuard_TriggerOrchestrator** - Metadata-driven trigger execution orchestrator
- **IScaleGuardTriggerHandler** - Interface for trigger handlers
- **DemoTriggerHandler** - Sample implementation of a trigger handler
- **ScaleGuard_Observability** - Core observability utilities
- **ScaleGuard_Logger** - Structured logging implementation
- **ScaleGuard_Correlation** - Correlation ID generation
- **ScaleGuard_AI_Triage** - Mocked AI/ML incident triage service
- **ScaleGuard_IncidentManager** - Incident management workflow coordinator
- **ScaleGuard_DemoDataLoader** - Demo data generation utilities

### 3. Data Layer
The data layer consists of custom objects and platform events that store and transmit information:

- **SG_Job__c** - Custom object storing job execution information
- **SG_LogEvent__e** - Platform event for structured logging
- **SG_ExecutionEvent__e** - Platform event for execution tracking
- **ScaleGuard_TriggerConfig__mdt** - Custom metadata for trigger configuration
- **SG_Incident__c** - Custom object for incident tracking (conceptual)

### 4. Integration Layer
The integration layer handles external system interactions:

- **Platform Events** - Real-time communication between components
- **Lightning Message Service** - Component-to-component communication
- **Mocked AI/ML Integration** - Simulated external service calls

## Component Interactions

### Trigger Orchestration Flow
1. Salesforce trigger fires on Account object
2. `AccountTrigger` delegates to `ScaleGuard_TriggerOrchestrator`
3. Orchestrator retrieves configurations from `ScaleGuard_TriggerConfig__mdt`
4. Handlers execute in configured order
5. Each handler logs events using `ScaleGuard_Logger`
6. Events published to `SG_LogEvent__e` platform event

### Observability Flow
1. All automation components use `ScaleGuard_Logger` for structured logging
2. Logs published to `SG_LogEvent__e` platform event
3. Dashboard components subscribe to platform events
4. Health metrics calculated by `ScaleGuard_Observability.getHealthMetrics()`
5. Traceability uses `ScaleGuard_Observability.getLogsByCorrelationId()`

### Incident Management Flow
1. User initiates incident analysis via `sgIncidentManagement`
2. System retrieves logs by correlation ID
3. `ScaleGuard_AI_Triage` analyzes logs for priority and category
4. `ScaleGuard_IncidentManager` creates mock ticket
5. Ticket information displayed in `sgTicketTracker`

## Data Flow Architecture

### Real-time Data Flow
```
[Salesforce Trigger] → [ScaleGuard_TriggerOrchestrator] → [Trigger Handlers] 
    ↓                              ↓
[Structured Logging] → [SG_LogEvent__e Platform Event] 
    ↓                              ↓
[Dashboard Components] ← [Platform Event Subscribers]
```

### Error Handling Architecture
1. All components use structured logging with correlation IDs
2. Errors logged with full context and stack traces
3. Real-time alerting system monitors ERROR severity logs
4. Correlation IDs enable complete traceability from trigger to resolution

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Lightning Web Components (LWC)
- Lightning Design System (SLDS)
- Lightning Message Service
- JavaScript ES6+

### Backend
- Apex Classes
- Custom Metadata Types
- Platform Events
- Salesforce DX

### Observability
- Nebula Logger integration
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Error alerting system

## Scalability Considerations

### Performance
- Bulkification of all operations
- Efficient SOQL queries with proper indexing
- Platform events for scalable messaging
- Caching where appropriate

### Reliability
- Error handling at every level
- Graceful degradation of features
- Asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Security
- Field-level security enforcement
- Proper RBAC through permission sets
- Secure correlation ID generation
- No sensitive data in logs

## Deployment Architecture

### Org Structure
- Custom objects for job tracking and logging
- Custom metadata for trigger configuration
- Platform events for communication
- Permission sets for access control

### CI/CD Integration
- Salesforce DX for source control
- Metadata-driven configuration
- Automated testing through Apex tests
- Deployment validation through test coverage

## Future Extensibility

### Planned Enhancements
1. Integration with external AI/ML services
2. Real integration with Jira/ServiceNow
3. Advanced alerting rules
4. Export functionality for log data
5. Historical trend analysis
6. Machine learning-based anomaly detection

### Modular Design
- All components loosely coupled
- Metadata-driven configuration
- Interface-based programming
- Easy addition of new trigger handlers
