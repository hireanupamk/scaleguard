# ScaleGuard Trigger Orchestration - Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy and coverage for the ScaleGuard trigger orchestration components. The goal is to ensure reliability, security, and performance of the metadata-driven trigger management system.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests

#### ScaleGuard_TriggerOrchestrator_Test
- Tests basic orchestrator functionality with valid parameters
- Verifies exception handling within orchestrator
- Tests bypass logic functionality
- Ensures orchestrator can be called without runtime errors

#### DemoTriggerHandler_Test
- Tests implementation of IScaleGuardTriggerHandler interface methods
- Verifies `execute()` method can be called without errors
- Tests `shouldExecute()` method returns expected boolean value
- Tests `getExecutionOrder()` method returns correct integer
- Tests `canBeBypassed()` method returns correct boolean value

#### IScaleGuardTriggerHandler_Test
- Verifies that DemoTriggerHandler properly implements the interface
- Ensures all required methods are accessible
- Validates method signatures and return types

#### ScaleGuard_Orchestration_Comprehensive_Test
- Tests orchestrator with edge cases (null parameters)
- Validates correlation ID generation
- Tests logger integration

### 2. Integration Tests

#### Trigger Integration Tests
- Tests AccountTrigger with various trigger events
- Verifies orchestrator delegation from trigger to handler
- Validates execution flow through the system

### 3. Security Tests

#### RBAC Testing
- Verify that only authorized users can modify trigger configurations
- Test that unauthorized access to trigger handlers is prevented
- Validate that sensitive operations require proper permissions

#### FLS Testing
- Ensure that trigger handlers respect field-level security
- Verify that handlers don't access restricted fields without permissions
- Test that data access is properly controlled

### 4. Performance Tests

#### Bulk Operation Testing
- Tests orchestrator performance with multiple handlers
- Validates memory usage patterns
- Ensures no governor limit violations during bulk operations

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Focus on individual component behavior
- Use mock data and controlled environments
- Test all code paths including error conditions
- Achieve 100% code coverage where feasible

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Validate data flow and transformations
- Ensure proper error propagation

### Security Testing
- Validate permission checks at all levels
- Test field-level security enforcement
- Verify data isolation between users
- Test bypass logic security controls

### Performance Testing
- Measure execution time for various scenarios
- Monitor memory consumption
- Validate governor limit compliance
- Test with large data sets

## Test Execution Guidelines

### Pre-Deployment
1. Run all unit tests to ensure no regressions
2. Verify all trigger configurations are valid
3. Confirm that all handlers implement the interface correctly
4. Test with representative data sets

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor system logs for any unexpected behavior
2. Validate that trigger execution order is maintained
3. Verify that bypass logic works as expected
4. Check that correlation IDs are properly tracked

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Requirements
- Minimal test data to cover all scenarios
- Representative data sets for bulk operations
- Edge case data for boundary condition testing
- Valid and invalid configurations for error handling

### Test Data Creation
- Use `@TestSetup` methods where appropriate
- Create test data in separate transactions
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use `System.runAs()` for different user contexts

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- All tests should run in CI pipeline
- Code coverage thresholds should be maintained
- Failed tests should block deployment
- Performance benchmarks should be monitored

### Test Maintenance
- Update tests when components change
- Remove obsolete tests
- Add tests for new features
- Review test coverage regularly

## Known Limitations

1. **Trigger Context Limitations**: Cannot fully mock real trigger contexts in unit tests
2. **Metadata Dependencies**: Tests depend on custom metadata configurations
3. **External Dependencies**: Some functionality depends on Nebula Logger and other components

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests for different trigger scenarios
2. **Add Negative Tests**: Include tests for invalid configurations and error conditions
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics for bulk operations
4. **Security Auditing**: Regular security reviews of trigger handler permissions
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for trigger execution times and error rates
